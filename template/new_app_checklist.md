## Notes

### Buy Me a Coffee banner — inverse theming

**What this means:**
The top banner (`BannerFrame`) is always the opposite of the main app theme.
In light mode the banner is dark navy; in dark mode the banner is light.
This makes it pop as a distinct brand anchor rather than blending into the content area.

**Why it works this way:**
The banner tokens in `my_app/theme.py` use genuinely opposite values for each mode:
```python
BANNER_BG   = ("#16212D", "#F1F5F9")  # dark in light mode, light in dark mode
BANNER_TEXT = ("#F1F5F9", "#16212D")  # light on dark banner, dark on light banner
```
CustomTkinter colour tuples are `(light_mode_value, dark_mode_value)`, so CTk picks the
correct value automatically when the user toggles the theme.

**Files involved:**

| File | What to check |
|---|---|
| `my_app/theme.py` lines 7–8 | `BANNER_BG` and `BANNER_TEXT` — first value dark, second value light |
| `my_app/ui/banner.py` line 31 | `BannerFrame.__init__` passes `fg_color=theme.BANNER_BG` — do not change this |
| `my_app/ui/banner.py` lines 44–54 | "Buy Me a Coffee" `CTkButton` — amber is readable on both dark and light banner backgrounds |
| `my_app/ui/banner.py` lines 56–64 | `CTkSwitch` — `text_color=theme.BANNER_TEXT` keeps the label readable in both modes |

**How to verify (smoke test steps):**
1. Run `python main.py`.
2. Observe the top banner — it must have a **dark navy background** regardless of the current mode.
3. Click the dark/light toggle switch in the banner → the main window background and all cards should switch between light and dark.
4. After toggling, the **banner must remain dark navy** — it must never turn white or light grey.
5. Confirm the "Buy Me a Coffee" amber button and all banner text remain legible (no low-contrast text or invisible buttons) in both modes.

**When porting to a new app:**
- Update the `_DONATION_URL` constant in `ui/banner.py` to the new app's Buy Me a Coffee page (or remove the button entirely if not needed).
- Keep `BANNER_BG` as a dark-on-dark tuple in `theme.py` to preserve the inverse appearance.
- If you change the banner background to a light colour, invert `BANNER_TEXT` and all button `text_color` values on the banner accordingly.
